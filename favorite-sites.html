		<h1>Favorite Sites</h1>
		<p>Here are some of my favorite sites from most favorite to least favorite:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><a href='https://reddit.com'>Reddit</a>
				<p>Love it or hate it, reddit has some of the <em>best</em> stuff on the internet. It also has some of the worst stuff.</p>

			</li>
			<li><a href='https://stackoverflow.com'>Stackoverflow</a>
				<p>A cesspool of some of the most pretentious, but helpful people on the planet. Never ask a question here,
				but learn from the poor saps that did.</p>

			</li>
			<li><a href='https://wikipedia.org'</a>Wikipedia</a>
				<p>Probably the only free resource I've ever donated to. The number of times Wikipedia has saved my academic career is too
				large to count.</p>

			<li><a href='index.html'>jakehamzawi.net</a>
				<p>Alright not really. I used to run a code server on this domain. Never really coded anything, but I learned
				a lot setting it up.</p>
			</li>
